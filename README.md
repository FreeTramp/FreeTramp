- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FreeTramp
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning.
I' am an developer from the past. Old, classic ASP developer. VBscript, MsSQL, etc...
I didn't jump into aspx at the 90's.
Now I decided to learn Razor pages. It seems good to and familiar to me with old classic asp.
Any help (teaching) is welcome.
